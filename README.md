## Continuous Improvements/Future Improvements
- Add a travel agency with a dedicated login and dashboard to manage new trip requests ("pending" trips). The dashboard will display total income generated, and the travel agency can approve/deny trip requests, search users by name, view a single user's information, add suggested activities, and delete upcoming trips for users. Additionally, travel agencies can create new destinations to expand their offerings.

- To enhance the user experience, add a countdown to the next trip on the user dashboard.

- Make the application fully responsive to different screen sizes, ensuring that it can be accessed easily on any device.

- Implement additional error handling to prevent duplicate trips and provide an even smoother user experience.
